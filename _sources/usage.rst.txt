Requirements
------------

Obviously, you'll need Python_.
The code has been developed and tested on Python 3.x only.
NumPy_ and SciPy_ are needed for calculations.
.. If you also want to plot the resulting sound fields, you'll need matplotlib_.

Instead of installing all of them separately, you should probably get a Python
distribution that already includes everything, e.g. Anaconda_.
