# 
# SOFA (Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics) files (https://www.sofaconventions.org) are HDF5 containers that
# hold data like Head-Related Impulse Responses (HRIRs), Binaural Room Impulse Responses (BRIRs) or Directional
# Impulse Responses (DRIRs, array impulse responses).
# 
# Additionally, they hold important meta information and are a great way to archive such recording data.
# Unfortunately, there currently is no Python API available (You may find at Matlab/Octave and C++ implementation
# here: https://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/Software_and_APIs).
# 
# Luckily, sofa files can be read using the netCDF4 package, the extracted impulse responses can then be saved into a
# format that is (currently) easier to work with like numpy's .npy. Note that this is much less optimized for
# file size!
# 
# ## Dependencies This example mainly relies on the **netCDF4** package to read in the sofa format.
# sound_field_analysis is only used for some format definitions.
# To be able to install netCDF4, having the packages hdf5 and netcdf installed was necessary. On OSX this worked by:
# brew install hdf5
# brew install netcdf
# pip install netCDF4

# ## Load .sofa file
# Plenty of sofa files are listed at https://www.sofaconventions.org/mediawiki/index.php/Files
# In this example, the "mit_kemar_large_pinna.sofa" was used.

# ## SOFA content
# If everything went correctly, you should see a description of the selection .sofa file above.
#
# Generally, HRIR / BRIR sets will have R=2 receiver positions (left and right ear) at I=1 listener position (usually
# 0,0,0), with impulse responses of M source positions (with E=1 emitter position, usually 0,0,0) of length N.
#
# Other data such as array recordings can have several receiver positions for a single source position and the script
# below needs to be adjusted accordingly.
#
# As an example, the ear distance is calculated as the difference between the y coordinates of the left and the right
# ear.

# ## Save as npy file
# To now write the data into the handy binary .npy format, we could simply call np.save().
# 
# Specifically for the sound_field_analysis toolbox, we convert the angles into radians (and elevation to colatitude),
# create an io.ArraySignal and finally save that.
